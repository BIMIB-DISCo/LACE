Longitudinal Analysis of Cancer Evolution (LACE)

LACE is an algorithmic framework that processes single-cell somatic mutation profiles from cancer samples collected at different 
time points and in distinct experimental settings, to produce longitudinal models of cancer evolution. The approach solves a Boolean Matrix 
Factorization problem with phylogenetic constraints, by maximizing a weighed likelihood function computed on multiple time points.
