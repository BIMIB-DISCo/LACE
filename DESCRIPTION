Name:
    LACE: an R package for the inference of longitudinal cancer evolution models
Description:
    LACE is an algorithmic framework that processes single-cell somatic mutation profiles from cancer samples collected at different time points and in distinct experimental settings, to produce longitudinal models of cancer evolution. The approach solves a Boolean Matrix Factorization problem with phylogenetic constraints, by maximizing a weighed likelihood function computed on multiple time points.
